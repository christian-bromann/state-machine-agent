# State-Machine-Style Agent Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of the simple yet powerful state machine agentic algorithm described in [this Twitter post](https://x.com/arafatkatze/status/1970171291295506491), which explains how Cline's agent works.

## The Core Algorithm

The agent operates as a **recursive loop** that continuously processes tool calls until the user is satisfied:

```
User Request â†’ Recursive Loop â†’ Tool Call â†’ Add Result to Context â†’ Loop Back â†’ Repeat
```

The agent classifies every tool call into **4 categories**:

1. **ðŸ“‹ New Task Tools** - Define what needs to be done
2. **ðŸ¤” Question Tools** - Ask for clarification (WAIT for user input)
3. **âš¡ Action Tools** - Gather context and perform work (ALWAYS continue)
4. **âœ… Completion Tools** - Present results and check user satisfaction

## How It Works

### Recursive Loop Architecture

The agent follows this simple but powerful pattern:

flowchart TD
  A[User Task] --> B{Recursive Loop}

  %% Recursive Loop sequence
  B --> C[API Request]
  C --> D[LLM Response]
  D --> E{Tool Call?}

  %% Tool Call branches
  E -->|Always Continue| F[Action Tools]
  F --> G[Add Result to Context]
  G --> B

  E -->|Wait and Continue| H[Question Tools]
  H --> I[Wait for User Input]
  I --> J[Add Response to Context]
  J --> B

  E -->|No Tool| K[Force Tool Use]
  K --> B

  E -->|Completion| L[attempt_completion]
  L --> M[Present Results]
  M --> N{User Response?}

  %% User Response branches
  N -->|Provides Feedback| O[Add Feedback to Context]
  O --> B
  N -->|Satisfied| P[Task Complete]
  P:::complete

  %% New Task (ONLY from Tool Call?)
  E -->|New Task| Q[new_task]
  Q --> R[Ask User]
  R --> S{User Choice?}
  S -->|Create New Task| T[End Current]
  T --> B
  S -->|Provide Feedback| U[Add Feedback to Context]
  U --> B

  classDef wait fill:#f9d69c,stroke:#d9a447,color:#000;
  classDef action fill:#d6b3ff,stroke:#a55eea,color:#000;

  F:::action
  I:::wait
```

### Tool Categories

#### ðŸ“‹ New Task Tools

- `new_task` - Define and confirm what needs to be done with user

#### ðŸ¤” Question Tools

- `ask_for_clarification` - When stuck or requests are ambiguous (uses `interrupt` for Human-In-The-Loop)
- `confirm_action` - Before potentially risky operations (uses `interrupt` for Human-In-The-Loop)

#### âš¡ Action Tools

- `read_file` - Read and examine file contents
- `list_files` - Explore directory structure
- `search_files` - Find patterns and content across files
- `write_to_file` - Make changes to files (with automatic backups)

#### âœ… Completion Tools

- `attempt_completion` - Present results and check if user is satisfied (uses `interrupt` for Human-In-The-Loop)

### Context Accumulation

The beautiful part is that **context builds naturally** through the recursive loop:

1. **Start**: `[System prompt + Available tools]`
2. **Tool Call**: Agent chooses appropriate tool based on context
3. **Add Result**: Tool result gets added to conversation memory
4. **Loop Back**: Continue with enriched context
5. **Repeat**: Until user is satisfied

Each tool call adds to the conversation memory, making the agent smarter with every iteration.

## Human-In-The-Loop Integration

This implementation uses LangGraph's **interrupt mechanism** for seamless Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) interactions:

- **Question Tools**: Use `interrupt` to pause execution and wait for user clarification
- **Completion Tools**: Use `interrupt` to present results and collect user satisfaction feedback
- **Task Definition**: Use `interrupt` to confirm task definitions with users
- **Seamless Flow**: Interrupts integrate naturally with the recursive loop architecture
- **State Persistence**: Agent state is maintained across interrupt boundaries

The interrupt-based approach ensures that user interactions are properly integrated into the agent's workflow without breaking the recursive loop pattern.

## Running the Demo

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:christian-bromann/state-machine-agent.git

# Make sure you have OpenAI API key set
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Install dependencies
corepack enable
pnpm install

# Run the demo
pnpm start
```

The demo runs 3 scenarios:

1. **Ambiguous request** â†’ NEW TASK â†’ QUESTION â†’ ACTION â†’ COMPLETION
2. **Clear action request** â†’ NEW TASK â†’ ACTION â†’ COMPLETION
3. **Request for summary** â†’ NEW TASK â†’ ACTION â†’ COMPLETION

Each scenario demonstrates different aspects of the recursive loop and tool categories. An example output can be found in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/christian-bromann/07ae625c3c0662996fdd525799955120).
